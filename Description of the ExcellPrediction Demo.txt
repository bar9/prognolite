Description of the ExcellPrediction DemoThe Prototype uses turnover data from the past year(s) to make a forecast for future sales. Based on the fact that turnover (daily revenue) is correlated (0.95) with table reservations and number of dishes sold, it can be used to make a prediction on how much food restaurant owner needs to by for the next day, week or month.The model also uses rolling window to adapt the forecast to any new unexpected circumstances.The prototype is built as following:Graphical analytics:- estimate the averaged turnover per day for every month (“average week of January”, for example)- estimate average for the year and visualise relative value for every given day of every given months to help estimate how many people to expectPrediction:- Estimate the yearly business growth trend- Apply this trend to the previously determined values of “average week of a given month” to make forecast for the next year- Correct the forecast with respect to any relevant conditions (weather, holidays)- Collect data for every passed day to correct the forecast (in this DEMO this is the competitor, who reduced the number of visitors, but was not the year before and therefore was not taken into account in the model based on the previous year data)Note: the influence of weather or a holiday was not numerically estimated and values were taken only for demonstration
